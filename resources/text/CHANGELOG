3.4.1
—————

Added:
▪ Toolbar editor can reset toolbars.
▪ Toolbar editor now uses iconified tool buttons.
▪ Double mouse click on feed or recycle bin items in feeds list now opens all messages of the item in newspaper mode.
▪ Columns in message list can be hidden/shown/reordered with context menu. (issue #115)
▪ Auto-update notification is now switchable. (issue #119)
▪ Messages which are not removed or restored are not instantly deleted from list, they are striked-through instead. This is more resource friendly.
▪ Message list is now not reloaded when doing batch message operations.
▪ Message list SQL queries are now fully adjustable. This will allow for integration of labels functionality in the future.
▪ Auto-update status of feeds is now more general and complete. (issue #91)
▪ Display feed title in list of messages. (issue #97)
▪ Displayed feeds can now be sorted by multiple columns. Do you want to sort by author, and THEN by title? Simply click first "Title" column, then on "Author" column. If you hold CTRL during sorting, the sort is done in reverse column order.

Changed:
▪ Updating of RSS Guard now uses GitHub API. (issue #109)
▪ Better ATOM/RSS parsing, respects now XML namespaces, bit better link parsing and other stuff. (issue #104)
▪ Folder which holds SQL scripts got renamed to "sql".
▪ Tweaked some conditions for determining newly "updated" messages in ATOM format. (issue #103)

Fixed:
▪ Tab not closing after close button click on Mac OS X. (#126)
▪ Wrong tab bar item close button position on Mac OS X. (#128)
▪ Settings and database are now stored in more standard directories on Mac OS X. (#127)
▪ Fixed regression when restoring deleted messages.
▪ Crash in TT-RSS plugin on application exit, when TT-RSS user needed to be logged out.

3.4.0
—————

Added:
▪ New icons (CC 3.0 BY) inspired by the work of Dave Gandy.
▪ "Cleanup database" action has now configurable shortcut. (issue #90)
▪ Fixed #76, now user can choose to "not show the dialog again" when opening hyperlink from message previewer. This only concerns the lite version of RSS Guard which uses simpler text component for message previewing.

Changed:
▪ (Linux only) Primary user data/config storage is now undex $HOME/.config/RSS Guard. XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable is respected. If old user data is detected, then old user data path is used. Note that the location of cache is now changed too to $XDG_{CACHE,DATA}_HOME/RSS Guard.
▪ RSS Guard now uses "_" character as localization file names separator. (issue #75)
▪ Localizations are now placed in "translations" subfolder instead of "l10n" subfolder. (issue #75)

3.3.8
—————

Fixed:
▪ Percent HTML encoding is now decoded when messages are downloaded. (bug #83)

3.3.6
—————

Added:
▪ User now can place custom user skins in user "data" folder. (issue #81) See "About" dialog for the exact path.
▪ User now can select if DB transactions are enabled or not. (bug #70) By default, DB transactions are now switched OFF, therefore anyone who wants better performance, must turn them ON in app settings.
▪ MySQL database backend now requires at least version 5.5, DB encoding is now changed to utf8mb4 character set. (bug #74)
▪ Height if message attachment image is now configurable, defaults to 36. (issue #69)
▪ All textual contents of all messages are now locally saved in explicit UTF-8 encoding. This is partially because of MySQL backend. We need to keep encoding of data sent to DB and encoding of DB itself in parity.

Changed:
▪ TT-RSS plugin now does NOT require service URL to be entered with "/api/" suffix. In other words, do not use that suffix now, RSS Guard will add it silently when it needs to.

Fixed:
▪ Fixed problem with strings in core being rendered untranslated. (bug #60)
▪ Fixed problem with feed updates progress bar flickering. (bug #73)
▪ Partially fixed problem with incorrect number of downloaded messages being reported. (bug #70)

3.3.5
—————

Added:
▪ Qt "styles" are now configurable via settings and not hardcoded in "skin" files. Default "style" is now "Fusion" and can be changed to anything else in settings.

Changed:
▪ Made some tweaks regarding bug #41. Number of new messages is now determined in feed downloader working thread too.

Fixed:
▪ Fixed problem with updating states of messages in Nextcloud. Remove and re-add your account to fix the problem!! (bug #59)

3.3.4
—————

Added:
▪ Development builds are now automatically compiled for Windows and Mac OS X. See https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/tree/build-artifacts for links and more information.
▪ RSS Guard now can be compiled WITHOUT QtWebEngine module. Minimal Qt required was also lowered to 5.6.0.

Changed:
▪ Obtaining feed metadata including icons is now improved a bit.
▪ Big application core refactoring. Many functions rewritten, some bad code removed.

Fixed:
▪ RSS Guard could not stop ongoing feed updates. (bug #52)
▪ RSS Guard was not launchable in Windows XP. (bug #53)
▪ RSS Guard crashed when switching msg status during feed updates. (bug #41)

3.3.3
—————

Added:
▪ Message viewer now displays thumbnails of image message attachments. (issue #39)
▪ Application settings is now divided into separate components on source code level.
▪ Application settings now offers "Apply" button which saves settings without closing the dialog. (issue #16)

Fixed:
▪ Correct message is now selected after some feed gets updated. Multi-selection is not maintained, only focused ("current") message selection is. (bug #46)
▪ RSS Guard correctly saves windows size/position when maximized on exit. (bug #45)

Changed:
▪ Focused message is now displayed in previewer when multiple messages are selected. This is related to bug #46.
▪ MariaDB binary DLL file updated to 10.1.16 (Windows only).

3.3.2
—————

Changed:
▪ Feed updating/message downloading logic is now a bit simpler. Message downloading is still parallelized but final storing into DB is not. It is now queued. This slows down the proces only a bit, but gives more reliability.

Fixed:
▪ Fixed problems with obtaining custom ID for downloaded messages in TT-RSS plugin. This caused probably a lot of problems with mismatch of downloaded/real unread messages counts.
▪ Fixed some typos.
▪ Fixed some UI stuff in menus etc.
▪ Fixed problem with skin loading. (bug #25)

You can see more verbose list of fixed stuff here: https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/milestone/2?closed=1

3.3.1
—————

Changed:
▪ Changed couple of icons. (bug #12)
▪ Changed codes of localizations and localizations loading. (bug #19)

Fixed:
▪ Fixed problematic message reselection when filtering messages.
▪ Fixed problem when updating 0 feeds - GUI lockup.
▪ Fixed minimum allowed length of category/feed titles. (bug #17)

3.3.0
—————

Added:
▪ Internal message viewer is now based on QtWebEngine module which is based on Chromium project. This speeds up viewing of messages and supports newest HTML 5 or CSS 3 features. Note that this does not mean that fully featured internal web browser will come back. It will not! Only SIMPLIFIED internal web browser is now added. New message viewer is also better for viewing messages in newspaper mode.
▪ Default skin now uses Bootrstrap-powered look.
▪ Feed updates are now parallelized up to infinite number of threads. This speeds up speed of concurrent feed updates rapidly (more than 5 times). I was able to update about 160 feeds in 35 seconds. Note that this feature is still in experimental state.
▪ Middle mouse button click on any message in message list opens message in internal web browser, double click in external web browser.
▪ Any middle mouse button click on hyperlink opens it in new internal web browser tab.

Changed:
▪ Minimal Qt version bumped to 5.7.0 - this will lead to some betere features in the future.
▪ Updated miscellaneous libraries - MariadDB, openSSL (Windows only).
▪ Main menu is by default hidden, tab bar is now always visible. Main menu is now accessible via left/top corner iconified button. Users can of course tweak settings in Tools -> Options -> User interface.

Removed:
▪ All skins except default are removed because it is difficult for me to maintain all of them. Any user can pickup removed skin from repository, tweak it (it is easy) and send it to me and I will include it with next version of RSS Guard.
▪ Cmake dependency completely removed!
▪ Completely abandoned support for self-updating via NSIS installers. Now, RSS Guard is distributed only via ZIP archives on Windows. User still can download them in RSS Guard.

Fixed:
▪ Removed "Restart" functionality, it was buggy and was causing a lot of internal problems, primarily with storing settings.
▪ OPML exporter now generates valid XML with all xmlns correctly filled.

3.2.4
—————

Fixed:
▪ Auto-update interval/type is now persistent across sync-in for TT-RSS/ownCloud.

3.2.3
—————

Changed:
▪ Some minor tweaks for default icon theme loading.


3.2.2
—————

Added:
▪ RSS Guard now supports system-wide icon themes and on Windows -> built-in Faenza theme was tweaked.

Fixed:
▪ Some minor buggies and code mistakes.
▪ Fixed problem with message counts.

3.2.1
—————

Added:
▪ Internal message previewer now introduces list of images contained in message contents of displayed message.

Fixed:
▪ Changes in count of all/unread messages are now faster. This results in (much) faster program startup when using BIG database file.

Changed:
▪ Internal message viewer now displays title as part of main HTML view.

3.2.0
—————

Main:
▪ Internal web browser was REMOVED. This is because old Qt WebKit web component will be removed from Qt and new Qt component for web viewing is based on Chromium, which is fucking joke. Some people hate Chromium because of many (technocal, philosophical, etical) reasons. Moreover, it lacks some useful features and is memory hungry. It is also very buggy in Qt now. Therefore now internal web browser is gone. Message preview component now uses much lighter solution and still can display certain HTML subset. RSS Guard was tweaked to be more friendly to external web browser. Double-clicking any message results in it being opened via external web browser.
▪ PLEASE, fill this survey: http://goo.gl/forms/ASWg4TFxlS
▪ RSS Guard now depends only Qt 5.6 or higher.

Added:
▪ ownCloud plugin now can delete feeds and edit auto-update policy of feeds.
▪ Global auto-update feed interval spinbox now has better format. (issue #176)
▪ Message preview's font is now fully adjustable in settings. (issue #177)
▪ RSS Guard now automatically switches to SQLite backend if MySQL is not available on program startup.
▪ Newspaper view now allows marking individual messages read/unread/starred/unstarred.
▪ Added experimental support for tweakable statusbar. (issue #158)
▪ Opening of download manager when new file download starts is now optional. (issue #165)

Fixed:
▪ Download manager now correctly displays download progress/info.
▪ Better detection of MySQL server status. (bug #169)
▪ Ordering of messages is now done on SQL server (stands for both MySQL and SQLite). (bug #172)
▪ Now title of the RSS/ATOM message is taken into account when deciding message "uniqueness". (bug #171)
▪ MySQL scripts improved. (bug #170)
▪ Fixed little problem with feed list hiding. (bug #163)

Changed:
▪ Better performance when recalculating counts of all/unread messages in categories with many feeds.
▪ Custom notification popup window is now removed, it was buggy on Windows 10. Windows 10 offers good built-in alternative. On Linux, we rely on D-Bus notifications.

3.1.0
—————

Added:
▪ NEW ACCOUNT PLUGIN: OwnCloud News API 1.2 is now supported. Note that the support in this version is experimental and relatively basic. So far only syncing of feeds/messages is supported. Feed/category adding/removing is not yet supported yet. The OwnCloud plugin will be enhanced in future RSS Guard versions.
▪ Recycle bins now have context menu. (issue #162)
▪ User is now able to delete TT-RSS feeds. (issue #151)

Fixed:
▪ Problem with adding/editing TT-RSS accounts. (bug #137)

3.0.0
—————

Added:
▪ Brand new Tiny Tiny RSS plugin.
▪ Brand new "service plugin system" - HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL and REWRITTEN from scratch. Expect bugs and misunderstandings now! Major parts of RSS Guard were completely rewritten. Note that some functionality might be TEMPORARILY removed.

▪ Added ability to hide status bar.
▪ Added ability to go to next unread message. (partially bug #112)

Fixed:
▪ Tiny Tiny RSS plugin now supports HTTP authentication (Basic, NTLM, Digest). (bug #132)
▪ Fixed bug with updating feed. (bug #131)
▪ Solved problem when user selects HUGE number of individual messages and marks them read/unread. Reselecting them after change may cause RSS Guard to hang.
▪ Better info in popup notification when many feeds are updated.
▪ Fixed obtaining of contents in RSS 2.0 feed entries. (bug #130)
▪ Improved popup informing about changes in newly installed version.

▪ Custom external web browser now correctly opens URLs on some operating systems. This seemed to primarily affect Linux distributions. (bug #123)
▪ Categories are now not expanded when selected using "Go to next/previous item" in feeds list. (bug #122)
▪ Added action to expand/collapse currently selected item in feeds list. (enhancement #121)

2.5.1
—————

Added:
▪ Key used for proxy/feed password coding is now stored in separate file. This file lies in the same directory as configuration file. If your use password-protected proxy/feeds, then make sure that NOBODY gets access to that file and your DB file in the same time.
▪ Notifications on Linux now support D-Bus "org.freedesktop.Notifications" service. User must have enabled "modern & fancy notifications" for this to work. If D-Bus service is not available, then feature falls back to RSS Guard custom popup notifications.

Fixed:
▪ Size of downloaded website artifacts is now not hidden by progress bar.
▪ Auto-updating of feeds fixed, error was due to master mutex double locking. (issue #117)
▪ Fixed some memory leaks which might appear when adding/editing categories/feeds.

2.5.0
—————

Added:
▪ Implemented ability to display ONLY FEEDS WITH SOME UNREAD MESSAGES. This behavior can be controlled by action in menu 'Feeds -> Show only unread feeds/categories' (issue #52). Behavior is this:

    ▪ User selects some feeds with unread messages, reads them all.
    ▪ User switches to another feed.
    ▪ Previously selected feed (now has no unread messages) is now hidden.
    
    Note that this feature also works when you e.g. mark message(s) as read/unread or when you restore some messages from recycle bin. Also when feeds are updated, then filter is invalidated.

▪ Password in feeds & proxy & MySQL are now saved in encrypted form. This means that all passwords from RSS Guard older than 2.5.0 are lost!!! Set your passwords again. Used encryption scheme is meant to only make sure that passwords are not stored in DB/settings in plain form. It is not meant to protect your passwords in any broader way. Attacker can exploit your passwords if he really wants.
▪ Fancy & modern popup notifications (turned on by default).
▪ Enhanced information in download manager.
Added ability to change font for internal message viewer.
▪ Updated URLs of some Adblock subscriptions.
▪ (Windows only) Updated bundled Qt runtime to versions 4.8.7/5.5.0. Pre-builded binaries use Qt 5. Although this results in larger installation files, this is good for future, because Qt 5 is newer and has better support.

Fixed:
▪ Adblock subscriptions starting with faulty " [Adblock..."] are now correctly loaded.

2.4.2
—————

Fixed:
▪ Browse button in 'Downloads' section of settings is now correctly disabled when needed.
▪ Icon cache is now automatically cleared after most of application is loaded. This should save some memory.

2.4.1
—————

Added:
▪ Experimental support for lighter version of Adblock component. It is configurable via status bar icon in bottom-right corner of main application window. It supports Adblock Plus filters. It is disabled by default. DO NOT user Adblock component if you wish to have LOW memory footprint or use very limited set of rules. Big set of rules makes RSS Guard more RAM hungry. (issue #7)
▪ Unavailable actions in menus are automatically disabled when such a situation arises. (issue #28)
▪ Added support for Google auto-suggest API. Just type your phrase in internal web browser location text box and Google will help you out.

Fixed:
▪ Source code now uses QStringLiteral/QLatin1String class for character literals.
▪ Internal message previewer is now cleared only once when switching feeds.
▪ Database cleanup tools now do support "shrinking" in in-memory databases, althouth it is bit hacky.

Fixed:
▪ Marking feed(s) unread now correctly marks also selected message unread.
▪ Threads for feed updating are created only when really needed.
▪ Reworked DB initialization scripts which allow to use OPML to do initial feed population.
▪ Titles and descriptions of feeds are now fetched correctly in feed add/edit dialog.
